## Research & Planning Log
### Friday, 02/17
* **8:15 am** begin filling out capstone proposal
* **8:45 am** capstone research
  * Video (15:00): [Shopify Hydrogen and Oxygen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvRzIIs6Trw&ab_channel=CodingwithJan-ShopifyDeveloper)
  * Video (7:30): [What is WooCommerce?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfZMnCGGqYc&ab_channel=IWDAgency)
    * *NTS: both of these options offer far more than I need for simple API integration in an existing web app -- and they have a fair amount of subscription fees. Going to look into other options.*
* **9:10 am** ask ChatGPT for library and framework reccommendations to use for a React web store. ChatGPT suggested I look into the following:
  * **Stripe**
  * **Commerce.js**
  * **Snipcart**
  * **Shopify Buy SDK**
  * **Gatsby + Shopify**
* **9:20 am** Stripe API research
  * Video (23:04): [How To Accept Payments With Stripe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1r-F3FIONl8&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified)
    * WebDevSimplified has an entire video tutorial series on the Stripe API. This looks like a promising stretch goal!
* **10:38 am** Playing with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play)
  * Video: (2:20) [TypeScript in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQnBQ4tB3ZA&ab_channel=Fireship)
    * TypeScript seems to be fairly easy to integrate into existing JavaScript code, just adds a lot more structure for a lot less headache. Should be able to use it from the get-go with some more reading.
* **11:15 am** Reading through TypeScript tutorials, taking notes on implementation within different React frameworks
  * [TypeScript for JS Programmers](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
  * [TypeScript with React](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/react.html)
  * [Create React App: TypeScript](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/)
* **11:50 am** Start Fireship video on JavaScript Frameworks
  * [I built the same app 10 times // Which JS Framework is best?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuHDQhDhvPE&ab_channel=Fireship)
    * Interested in Next.js for React

---

* **2:00 pm** Begin Next.js [tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=nav-cta&utm_campaign=next-website)
* **2:50 pm** Still going through Next.js tutorial
* **3:54 pm** Finish Next.js foundations tutorial. Start going through LHTP React with NoSQL reading
  * *NTS: Check out the [Next.js app tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app?utm_source=next-site&utm_medium=homepage-cta&utm_campaign=next-website) after more React foundations*
* **4:40 pm** Reading about different built-in hooks in [React Docs](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react)
